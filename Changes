Version 1.1

Hint now lasts as long as the user wishes. Hint button is Show/Hide Hint.

Added Practice mode. A new game is always in Timed mode but user can switch to Practice mode, in which case the score is not displayed.

State is now saved when you quit if we are in practice mode. I might extend this to always saving it but don't count on it.

Added some new clarifying animations.
