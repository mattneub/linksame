<p>LinkSame reconstructs MacLinkSame, a popular PPC Mac OS X application by Zheng Xiaoping, released in 2004 and no longer supported, nor even, as far as I can tell, available.</p>

<p>The basic rules (which turn out to be based on the traditional Shisen-Sho) are simple. All you have to do is spot a pair of tiles bearing the same picture, such that the <b>centers</b> of the tiles can be connected by a path, where:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The path is made up entirely of <b>straight line</b> segments.</li>
	<li>All line segments in the path are <b>horizontal or vertical</b>.</li>
	<li><b>No</b> segment of the path <b>crosses any other tile</b>.</li>
	<li>The path consists of <b>one, two, or three</b> segments.</li>
</ol>

<p>Select both tiles to remove them from the board.</p>

<p>Proceed in this way to clear the board, one pair of tiles at a time. There are nine stages to the game, differing in how the pieces slide to occupy the empty spaces left by removed tiles; so to finish the game and earn a final score, you must clear the board nine times. You can configure a game to consist of fewer stages, but you must still finish all those stages in order to receive a score.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a timer is running, and your score is based on your speed.</p>

<p>My scoring system is a little different from the original MacLinkSame. MacLinkSame imposed a countdown timer on each stage; if you didn&#8217;t clear the board before time ran out, the game ended prematurely. I want you to be able to finish the game every time, but I still want to reward alacrity and punish sloth. So my scoring system works like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">You get 1 point for removing a pair of tiles.</li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">You get bonus points for making pair-removals in quick succession - under ten seconds, and the faster the better. You can pretty easily get 10 bonus points per move if you&#8217;re quick.</li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">To encourage you not to fall asleep at the wheel, you <i>lose</i> 1 point for every 10 seconds of inactivity. This loss is emphasized by showing the score in red.</li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">If you are at a stand, you may ask for a <b>hint</b>. A legal path appears on the screen until you dismiss it by tapping. But you <i>lose 10 points</i> for doing this. This loss can in fact be worth it; if the hint causes you to spot multiple paths, you can quickly make up the loss with bonus points.</li>
	<li style="margin: 10px 0;">Alternatively, you can ask for the pieces to be <b>reshuffled</b>. The pieces presently on the board are gathered up, reshuffled, and replaced into the same locations. This can make pairs easier to spot, but you <i>lose 20 points</i>. Again, you may be able to make up the loss by a couple of rapid moves after the shuffle. You never <i>need</i> to reshuffle, however, since the board is reshuffled automatically if a configuration is reached where there are no legal paths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike the original MacLinkSame, there is no limit to the number of shuffles or hints you can request per stage; the loss of points is, I think, sufficient to discourage you from using those features too frequently. Also, you can restart the current stage without penalty; thus, if you feel you are playing a stage too slowly, you can try again with the same layout of tiles.</p>

<p>Your position is saved after every stage. If you leave the game in the middle of a stage, however, your position is <i>not</i> saved: instead, when you return, the stage will start over. The idea is that during a stage the timer is running and the pressure is on, and you can&#8217;t escape it. You can rest in the middle of a stage, though, by summoning the control center or notification center (the timer will pause).</p>

<p>If you dislike the time pressure, you can turn off scoring altogether by switching from Timed mode to Practice mode. (This feature is not available in the iPhone version of LinkSame.) In that case, you can pause at any time, because there&#8217;s no timer; and if you leave the game, your position <i>is</i> saved. Every new game starts in Timed mode; to switch from Practice mode to Timed mode, simply begin a new game.</p>
